Invaders from... Space!
-----------------------

Pew pew!

[Play](https://invaders-from-space.glitch.me/)

I created this game to explore and practice modern JavaScript. The code is pretty vanilla, mainly ES6 style with no compilation so view source etc works as [Tim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) intended. 

[Pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/) is used for graphics/animation and is the only external dependency. I also used [PWA builder](http://manifoldjs.com/generator) to generate the manifest and service worker for that offline PWA goodness.

Originally a [pen](https://codepen.io/joegaffey/pen/KqgGNE), invaders was moved to [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/invaders-from-space) when it needed more room to grow.

The server files are part of the Glitch template and are currently not used. I decided to keep them for now in case I want to add a backend later.

Tested (a little) in Chrome (Windows, Android), Firefox (Windows) and Edge.

Thanks to [Classic Gaming](http://www.classicgaming.cc) for the [sound effects](http://www.classicgaming.cc/classics/space-invaders/sounds)!
